# leetcode-log

Solving a couple of LeetCode Python problems daily (1–2) and uploading them with notes — so I can look back later and see how I’ve grown.

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.  
The main goal is to track my learning process by saving my code along with explanations and thoughts behind each solution.

## Objective

- Improve programming skills
- Get more comfortable with algorithmic thinking
- Build a habit of solving problems logically and reflecting on the process
