# leetcode-log

Solving a couple of LeetCode Python problems daily (1â€“2) and uploading them with notes â€” so I can look back later and see how Iâ€™ve grown.

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.
The main goal is to track my learning process by saving my code along with explanations and thoughts behind each solution.

## Objective

- Improve programming skills
- Get more comfortable with algorithmic thinking
- Build a habit of solving problems logically and reflecting on the process

## Weekly Plan

ðŸ“Œ Starting with a goal of solving 2 easy problems a day for a month to build the habit. (Apr 2025)

| Day            | Plan                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Mon â€“ Fri**  | âœ… Solve 2 Easy problems daily            |
| **Saturday**   | ðŸ”¥ Try 1 Medium or review past problems   |
| **Sunday**     | ðŸ§  Tackle 1 Hard problem deeply            |
