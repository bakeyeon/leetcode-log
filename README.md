# leetcode-log

Solving a couple of LeetCode Python problems daily (1â€“2) and uploading them with notes â€” so I can look back later and see how Iâ€™ve grown.

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.
The main goal is to track my learning process by saving my code along with explanations and thoughts behind each solution.

## Objective

- Improve programming skills
- Get more comfortable with algorithmic thinking
- Build a habit of solving problems logically and reflecting on the process
